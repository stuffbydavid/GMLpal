A handy tool for GameMaker:Studio users, it allows developers to perform project-wide code find and replace (using RegEx or regular search querys) along with viewing neat statistics, such as line of code count and game size.

Note: This is for GameMaker:Studio 1.x only! Feel free to fork and add 2.x support if you can.
