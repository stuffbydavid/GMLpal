A handy tool for GameMaker: Studio users, it allows developers to perform project-wide code find and replace (using RegEx or regular search querys) along with viewing neat statistics, such as line of code count and game size.

<b>Note</b>: This is for GameMaker: Studio 1.x projects only! Feel free to fork and add 2.x support if you can.
